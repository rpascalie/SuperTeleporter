# Super Teleporter

Hello!

This is a simple 2D platformer where the player has a teleport ability and can be played [here](https://rpascalie.github.io/SuperTeleporter/).
The player can also jump, double jump and wall jump.

I am still working on it and plan to add more levels playing around the teleportation. 
It is my first somewhat complete Unity game, I appreciate any feedback!

I used the following assets:

- [2D Casual UI HD](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/2d-casual-ui-hd-82080)

- [Pixel Adventure 1](https://assetstore.unity.com/?q=pixel%20adventure%201&orderBy=1)

- [Casual Game Sounds](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-54116)
